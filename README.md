### Tasks  

1. **Otsu Thresholding with Gaussian Noise**  
   - Generate a synthetic image with 2 objects and 1 background (3 pixel values).
   - Add Gaussian noise to the image.
   - Apply **Otsu’s Thresholding Algorithm**.

2. **Region Growing Segmentation**  
   - Implement region growing starting from seed points inside the object.
   - Recursively add neighboring pixels within a pre-defined intensity range.
